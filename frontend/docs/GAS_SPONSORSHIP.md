# Gas Sponsorship Configuration Guide

## üöÄ Overview

Digital House uses **Privy's Gas Sponsorship** to sponsor gas fees for users' transactions. This provides a seamless Web2-like experience where users don't need to worry about gas fees.

## üéØ What Gets Sponsored

When properly configured, these transactions can be sponsored:

- ‚úÖ Creating vaults
- ‚úÖ Making reservations
- ‚úÖ Placing bids
- ‚úÖ Ceding reservations
- ‚úÖ Check-in/Check-out operations
- ‚úÖ Any contract interaction

## üìã Prerequisites

- Privy account with app created
- Access to [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/)
- Embedded wallets enabled in your app
- Credit card on file (for production use)

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Gas Sponsorship in Privy Dashboard

1. **Navigate to your app in Privy Dashboard:**
   - Go to [dashboard.privy.io](https://dashboard.privy.io/)
   - Select your Digital House app

2. **Go to Gas & Asset Management:**
   - Click on "Settings" in the left sidebar
   - Navigate to "Gas & Asset Management"
   - Click "Enable Gas Sponsorship"

3. **Configure Gas Policies:**
   - Click "Create Policy"
   - Select the chains you want to sponsor:
     - ‚úÖ Ethereum Sepolia (11155111)
     - ‚úÖ Arbitrum Sepolia (421614)
     - ‚úÖ Base Sepolia (84532)

4. **Set Spending Limits (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```
   Per Transaction: 0.01 ETH (or your preferred limit)
   Daily Limit: 1 ETH
   Monthly Limit: 10 ETH
   ```

5. **Configure Contract Allowlist:**
   - Add your deployed contract addresses:
     ```
     DigitalHouseFactory: 0x_your_factory_address
     ```
   - Or allow all contracts (not recommended for production)

6. **Save and Activate:**
   - Review your settings
   - Click "Save Policy"
   - Toggle "Active" to enable

### 2. Configure in Your App

The gas sponsorship is already configured in the code. No additional changes needed!

```typescript
// Already configured in PrivyProviderWrapper.tsx
<PrivyProvider
  appId={PRIVY_CONFIG.appId}
  clientId={PRIVY_CONFIG.clientId}
  config={{
    embeddedWallets: {
      createOnLogin: 'users-without-wallets',
    },
    // Gas sponsorship works automatically with embedded wallets
  }}
/>
```

### 3. Using Gas Sponsorship in Components

Use the `useSponsoredTransaction` hook:

```typescript
import { useSponsoredTransaction } from '@/lib/hooks/useSponsoredTransaction';

function MyComponent() {
  const { sendSponsoredTransaction, isLoading, canSponsor } = useSponsoredTransaction();

  const handleTransaction = async () => {
    const txHash = await sendSponsoredTransaction({
      to: contractAddress,
      data: encodedFunctionCall,
      chainId: 11155111, // Sepolia
    });

    console.log('Transaction sent:', txHash);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleTransaction} disabled={!canSponsor || isLoading}>
      {canSponsor ? 'Send (Free Gas)' : 'Send (Gas Required)'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## üí° How It Works

### For Users with Embedded Wallets (Email/Social Login)

1. User logs in with email/social
2. Privy creates an embedded wallet automatically
3. User initiates a transaction (e.g., create vault)
4. **Gas is automatically sponsored by Digital House**
5. Transaction completes without user paying gas
6. User only needs PYUSD for stakes, not ETH for gas!

### For Users with External Wallets (MetaMask, etc.)

- Gas sponsorship is **NOT available**
- Users must have ETH in their wallet for gas
- This is a Privy limitation - sponsorship only works with embedded wallets

## üìä Monitoring Usage

### Privy Dashboard

1. Go to "Analytics" ‚Üí "Gas Sponsorship"
2. View:
   - Total gas spent
   - Transactions sponsored
   - Cost per chain
   - Daily/monthly trends

### In Your App

```typescript
// Check if sponsorship is available
const { isAvailable, walletType } = useGasSponsorship();

if (isAvailable) {
  console.log('‚úÖ Gas sponsorship available');
} else {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è User needs embedded wallet for sponsorship');
}
```

## üí∞ Costs & Billing

### Testnet (Free)

- Gas sponsorship on testnets (Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, Base Sepolia) is **FREE**
- No credit card required for testing
- Perfect for ETH Online 2024 hackathon!

### Mainnet (Production)

When you're ready to go to production:

1. **Add Payment Method:**
   - Go to Privy Dashboard ‚Üí Billing
   - Add credit card

2. **Costs:**
   - Pay only for actual gas used
   - Privy charges gas cost + small fee
   - Typical costs:
     - Simple transaction: ~$0.10-$0.50
     - Complex contract call: ~$1-$5

3. **Set Budgets:**
   - Configure spending limits to control costs
   - Get alerts when approaching limits

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Contract Allowlist

**Always use a contract allowlist in production:**

```
Allowed Contracts:
- DigitalHouseFactory: 0xYourFactoryAddress
- DigitalHouseVault: 0xYourVaultTemplate (if applicable)
```

This prevents:
- Users calling arbitrary contracts with your sponsored gas
- Abuse of gas sponsorship feature
- Unexpected costs

### Spending Limits

**Set reasonable limits:**

```
Per Transaction: 0.01 ETH (prevents single large transaction)
Per User Daily: 0.1 ETH (prevents abuse by single user)
Total Daily: 1 ETH (overall safety net)
Total Monthly: 10 ETH (budget control)
```

### Monitoring

**Set up alerts:**
- Email when 50% of daily limit reached
- Email when 80% of monthly limit reached
- Slack integration for real-time monitoring

## üß™ Testing Gas Sponsorship

### 1. Test in Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create Test User

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Choose "Email" or "Google" (NOT external wallet)
4. Complete login flow
5. Privy creates embedded wallet automatically

### 3. Trigger Sponsored Transaction

1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Create Vault" (or any other action)
3. Check browser console for logs:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Gas sponsorship available
   ‚úÖ Transaction sent: 0x123...
   ```

### 4. Verify in Privy Dashboard

1. Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Gas Sponsorship
2. Should see the transaction listed
3. Verify gas was sponsored (cost = $0 for testnet)

## üéì Example Usage

### Complete Example: Create Vault with Sponsored Gas

```typescript
'use client';

import { useSponsoredTransaction } from '@/lib/hooks/useSponsoredTransaction';
import { encodeFunctionData, parseUnits } from 'viem';
import { FACTORY_ADDRESS } from '@/lib/config';

export default function CreateVaultExample() {
  const { sendSponsoredTransaction, isLoading, canSponsor } = useSponsoredTransaction();

  const createVault = async () => {
    if (!canSponsor) {
      alert('Please use email/social login for gas sponsorship');
      return;
    }

    try {
      // Encode function call
      const data = encodeFunctionData({
        abi: FactoryABI,
        functionName: 'createVault',
        args: ['VAULT-001', 'My Property', parseUnits('1000', 6)],
      });

      // Send transaction with sponsored gas
      const txHash = await sendSponsoredTransaction({
        to: FACTORY_ADDRESS,
        data,
        chainId: 11155111, // Sepolia
      });

      console.log('‚úÖ Vault created! TX:', txHash);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('‚ùå Error:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={createVault} disabled={!canSponsor || isLoading}>
        {isLoading ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Vault (Free Gas)'}
      </button>

      {!canSponsor && (
        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Gas sponsorship not available. Login with email/social.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Gas Not Being Sponsored

**Check:**
1. User logged in with email/social (not external wallet)
2. Embedded wallet created (check in Privy dashboard)
3. Gas policy is active in dashboard
4. Contract address is in allowlist
5. Transaction is on a supported chain

### Transaction Failing

**Common issues:**
1. Spending limit reached ‚Üí Increase limits in dashboard
2. Contract not allowlisted ‚Üí Add to allowlist
3. Chain not supported ‚Üí Enable in gas policy
4. Insufficient PYUSD ‚Üí User needs tokens for stake (not gas)

### Monitoring Shows No Data

**Verify:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for dashboard to update
2. Check correct environment (testnet vs mainnet)
3. Ensure transactions actually sent
4. Check browser console for errors
